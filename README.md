## 🌟 About Me
- 🔴 I’m currently working as a Flutter Developer with learning interest in DevOps Tools, along with my Final Year Project.
- 🔴 I’m currently learning DevOps Tools, Cloud Technologies.
- 🔴 I’m looking to collaborate on Flutter projects.
- 🔴 I write blogs on Medium sharing my insights on DevOps technologies

## 📝 Blog Posts
- [Blog 1: Docker vs. Virtual Machines and their Implications: A Comparative Analysis](https://medium.com/@khalidhamza410/docker-vs-virtual-machines-and-their-implications-a-comparative-analysis-366909fd79c6)
Published on 9th September: In this blog, I've emphasized on Docker's lightweight and efficient container model, which shares the host OS kernel to avoid the overhead associated with VMs. This results in faster startup times, greater resource efficiency, and better scalability, making containers ideal for microservices, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud-native applications. However, I have also addressed the fact that shared kernel in containers presents some security challenges, while VMs provide stronger isolation through hardware-level virtualization, making them better suited for environments requiring robust security or multiple OS support. Overall, the blog focuses on how Docker containers and virtual machines (VMs) differ in terms of architecture, performance, scalability, and use cases.
  
- [Blog 2: Knative: The Future of Cloud-Native Applications](https://medium.com/@khalidhamza410/knative-the-future-of-cloud-native-applications-5f3a355e7bb2)
Published on 13th October: In this blog, I've introduced Knative, an open-source platform that simplifies deploying and managing serverless applications on Kubernetes. Knative streamlines the process by automating tasks like container building, pushing to registries, and deploying applications using simple YAML files. It consists of three main components: Serving (for serverless applications), Eventing (for event-driven architectures), and Build (for building container images). I’ve also provided a step-by-step workflow along with .YAML code snippets and commands for creating and deploying a simple serverless application using Knative.

## 📖 DevOps Tools I've learned about:

🔴Git: Version control system for managing source code.

🔴Jenkins: Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tool.

🔴Docker: Containerization tool for building and deploying applications.

🔴Kubernetes: Container orchestration platform for automating containerised application deployment, scaling, and management.

🔴Terraform: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for provisioning and managing cloud resources.

🔴Istio: Service mesh for Kubernetes, offering traffic management, observability, and security for microservices.

🔴Kyverno: Kubernetes-native policy engine to validate, mutate, and enforce security policies.

🔴GitLab CI: CI/CD tool integrated with GitLab for automating code delivery pipelines.
