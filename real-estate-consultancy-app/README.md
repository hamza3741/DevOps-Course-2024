# React Web Application with Nginx & Docker

This Real Estate Portfolio application demonstrates how to containerize a web app using Docker and serve it using Nginx. It is built for a DevOps course, where the goal is to use Docker to deploy and run the application with minimal manual steps.

## Features

- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Built with React for a fast and responsive user experience.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Fully containerized using Docker to simplify deployment and scalability.
- **Static File Hosting via Nginx**: Nginx is used to serve the static files of the React app after building it.
- **Production-Ready Build**: Optimized build process with `npm run build` for a production environment.
